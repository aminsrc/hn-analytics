## Hackernews Analytics

I read hackernews all the time and always wondered which articles make it to the top and which articles don't. To answer this question, I'll scrape the HN website periodically to trace the change of rank for each article. Once I have a good chunk of history on how article ranking changes over time, I'll try to answer that question.
